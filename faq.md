#### I want to swap my ZNN to the New Network.

A community member made a simple walk through video [here](https://youtu.be/Ge9BMVHC5JA?t=34).

**Is there an explorer for the NoM? **

Yes - [Zenon Network Explorer](https://explorer.znn.space)&#x20;

**What is a Momentum? **

A Momentum is similar to a block in a regular blockchain, but it comprises information from both the DAG layer and the Block Lattice layer. This published package of information from the two layers of the NoM is called a Momentum and like a block in the Bitcoin chain, it is tamper-proof and irreversible once published.

**What is NoM 0 ? **

NoM 0 is the first stage of the Network of Momentum. It will last approximately 1 year.

**In which wallets can I store ZNN? **

Network of Momentum ZNN can be stored in the Syrius Wallet. Wrapped ZNN can be stored in any Web.3 wallet like Metamask. Legacy ZNN can ONLY be stored in the Legacy wallet.

**Is there a mobile wallet for Zenon? **

Not as yet. Zenon Network will release a mobile wallet and Community developed mobile wallets are being built.

**Can I store ZNN in a hardware wallet?**

ZNN is a new protocol and as such is not yet supported in hardware wallets. You can however store wZNN in a hardware wallet.

**What is the staking return? **

In the SYRIUS wallet staking ZNN for QSR has an APY of up to 26%. Delegating to a Node has an APY of up to 72% These figures are dependent on fluctuating conditions. Figures shown are from the [Zenon.Network](https://zenon.network/#downloads) page.

**I received Quasar QSR, what can I do with it? **

QSR can be swapped directly to ZNN within the Syrius Wallet. It can also be used to generate Plasma for zero fee transactions.

**How do I get Plasma for sending fee-less transactions? **

ZNN can be swapped for QSR within the Syrius Wallet. That QSR can be sent to any address you are using for transactions and fused to that Address in the Plasma tab of the Syrius wallet.

**Is Zenon Network really Fee-less? **

Yes. You do however need to fuse QSR to the transaction address to drive zero-fee transactions. That QSR can be un-fused at any time with no loss of QSR.

**How can I support the Network? **

The Network of Momentum is supported by Pillars, Sentinels and Sentries. These are Nodes each with their own commitment levels and rewards. See [here](more-information/nodes-pillars-and-sentinels.md) for more information.

**What are some good sources of information to familiarise myself with the project? **

Both Community Articles and Official articles are linked [here](./).

**Can I keep the Legacy ZNN in my Legacy Wallet after the new network has launched?**

Legacy ZNN are safe in the Legacy Wallet but need to be swapped over to the NoM. Penalties for late swap are incurred 3 months after Alphanet launch.

**I left my ZNN on an exchange, what will happen to them? **

It is entirely up to the Exchanges to honour your purchase of Legacy ZNN and swap them out for NoM ZNN.

**Must I do something to swap to the new Network? **

Yes - you will have to swap the Legacy ZNN over to your Syrius Wallet yourself. Tutorials are [here](more-information/swap-to-alphanet.md).

**Will Zenon bridge with chains like Fantom, ETH or AVAX, similar to the current BSC Bridge?**&#x20;

All EVM chains are compatible with the Zenon Bridge implementation and can be extended to work two-way after Alphanet launch.

**What will be the program language for Alphanet? Will it be the same for both coins and the token? **

The code is written in Go, but SDKs will be provided for the most popular programming languages.

### **wZNN ( wrapped ZNN )**

**What is wZNN? **

The Zenon team created the option to buy and trade a version of ZNN on Pancakeswap on the Binance Smart Chain ( wZNN on BSC ) using a Web.3 wallet like Metamask. wZNN will remain as a cross-chain version of ZNN and have price parity.

**Can I store wZNN in Metamask? **

Yes. wZNN is a BSC token that can be stored in any compatible Web.3 wallet.

**Can I store wZNN in a hardware wallet? **

Yes, wZNN is a BSC token and as such can be stored in a Ledger or Trezor wallet.

**What is the new wZNN contract address? **

Token contract address: 0x84b174628911896a3b87fa6980d05dbc2ee74836

**What is the contract address for the wZNN BNB liquidity pool on Pancakeswap? **

Liquidity Pool contract address: 0xE6B03fCB16dAf3462DdfB8B0AFb3F0E87d38d884

**Can I swap my ZNN for wZNN? **

A bridge between Syrius and BSC will be opened after Alphanet.

**Can I stake wZNN that I bought on Pancakeswap? **

No - wZNN cannot be staked. Passive income can be earned by adding liquidity to the Pancakeswap pool and receiving rewards in your Syrius Wallet.

**Is wZNN part of the total supply of ZNN? **

Yes - wZNN is created by burning ZNN at the bridge, it does not dilute the total supply of ZNN.

**Why can I not see the wZNN in my Web.3 wallet? **

Make sure you have the correct contract address. In your Web.3 wallet under BSC add the token address 0x84b174628911896a3b87fa6980d05dbc2ee74836.

**Why is there a bridge to Binance Smart Chain versus other chains? **

BSC was initially chosen to be used for a one-way bridge because of EVM compatibility and low fees, facilitating ease of transfer for buyers and sellers.
