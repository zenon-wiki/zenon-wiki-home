#### What is ZENON Network of Momentum? <a href="what-is-zenon-network-of-momentum" id="what-is-zenon-network-of-momentum"></a>

The Zenon Network of Momentum ( NoM ) is an evolutionary “Blockchain” 3.0. It has a Dual Layer Structure with a DAG ( Directed Acyclic Graph ) base layer, and a Block Lattice transaction layer. The Network is secured through both Proof of Work ( POW ) and Proof of Stake ( POS ). It is powered by two coins; Zenon/ZNN is the fundamental transactional coin and Quasar/QSR the fuel coin which secures the Network through Proof of Stake.

The NoM has a fall-back Proof of Work security mechanism - in that if you do not have Quasar/QSR you will still be able to transact, albeit at a slower pace, by generating Proof of Work for each transaction.

“Fusing” Quasar within your wallet stakes the coin QSR and generates “Plasma” to fuel transactions. The more transactions you do, the more Quasar you need to fuse to drive those transactions. If you do not have enough Quasar the transaction will fall back to POW to drive it, ensuring that no transaction is ever ‘stuck’ in the Network, it will always get through somehow.

Other than that the Network of Momentum is fee-less.

The Network of Momentum has been in development and refinement since 2018. Due for launch towards the end of 2021. That launch will be called “The Big Bang” and at that time the “Alphanet” will go live.

#### What is the ZNN coin currently in circulation? <a href="what-is-the-znn-coin-currently-in-circulation" id="what-is-the-znn-coin-currently-in-circulation"></a>

While the Network of Momentum has been in development the Zenon team put in place a temporary network built on a fork of PIVX, with its own wallet. That wallet is called the Legacy Wallet and the current ZNN coin you can buy on CEX’s is actually a PIVX coin which can be stored ONLY within the Legacy Zenon Wallet OR on the exchanges where you can buy ZNN.

If you chose to store you PIVX Zennies in the Legacy Wallet you were able to stake your coins for rewards, which arrived as 0.9 ZNN, at intervals depending on the size of your stake and the duration of your wallet being online. ( Hot staking ). Very broadly the rewards were about 0.9 ZNN per 1000 ZNN staked and online per day. This program is still running, but rewards seem to be slowing down.

## Alphanet <a href="alphanet" id="alphanet"></a>

#### What is the Alphanet? <a href="what-is-the-alphanet" id="what-is-the-alphanet"></a>

The launch of the fully functioning first version of the Network of Momentum is called “The Big Bang” by the Zenon team. At that time the Syrius wallet will be updated and that update will run on the live Network of Momentum, not the testnet. That live initial network is called the Alphanet. Due for launch towards the end of 2021.

#### I have the “old” ZNN, what happens with them? <a href="i-have-the-old-znn-what-happens-with-them" id="i-have-the-old-znn-what-happens-with-them"></a>

**The Big Swap.** You will be able to permanently swap your Legacy Zennies for the NoM Zennies, which will be held in your updated Syrius wallet once the Network of Momentum goes live as the Alphanet.

**How - The Big Swap.** Once the NoM is live as the Alphanet, you will be able to swap the Legacy ZNN for Nom ZNN using the Legacy Wallet ONLY. You will not be able to do the swap via a CEX where you bought your PIVX ZNN. So everyone who has Legacy ZNN will need to fire up version 1.6.5 ( or later ) of the Legacy Zenon wallet, move your Legacy ZNN off an exchange to the Legacy Wallet and swap from there to the NoM Syrius Wallet. This means you will need to run the latest versions of BOTH the Legacy ZNN wallet and the Syrius Wallet ( so you have a Syrius address to send to ) Links to the latest wallets are found at the bottom of the official Zenon.Network page.

The swap will be similar in process to the testnet swap, which went well. Here’s the how-to for the test swap. [https://medium.com/@zenon.network/swapdrop-event-october-1st-bd99964589aa](https://medium.com/@zenon.network/swapdrop-event-october-1st-bd99964589aa)

**Swap Time Window.** This will be a forced swap - you have 1 year to move your Legacy ZNN to NoM ZNN, receiving all of your swapped ZNN in the beginning and less and less as time goes by. After 1 year the PIVX chain will be deleted and any ZNN remaining on that chain will be lost. No point in having the old ZNN around anymore.

**Option to bridge “old” ZNN to wZNN on Binance Smart Chain.**

The Zenon team created the option to buy and trade a version of ZNN on Pancakeswap on the Binance Smart Chain ( wZNN on BSC ) using a Web.3 wallet like Metamask. You could swap ZNN from your Legacy Wallet on the PIVX chain for wZNN on Binance Smart Chain through a one-way bridge at a cost of 1 ZNN per 100 ZNN swapped. ( Send 100 ZNN, receive 99 wZNN ). You are still able to cross the one-way bridge from your Legacy Wallet to BSC if you want to trade your ZNN on Pancakeswap. wZNN is still active and it seems will remain so into the future as a cross-chain version of ZNN.

More info from Zenon. [https://medium.com/@zenon.network/zenon-building-bridges-272538cde1a7](https://medium.com/@zenon.network/zenon-building-bridges-272538cde1a7)

Once you have wZNN you will be able to bridge those wZNN ( wrapped ZNN ) on Binance Smart Chain back to NoM ZNN in Syrius. That bridge will be two-way and is not yet active.

#### What is the Syrius Wallet. <a href="what-is-the-syrius-wallet" id="what-is-the-syrius-wallet"></a>

The first public tests of the Network of Momentum began in 2021. These public tests were signalled with the release of the Syrius wallet. These initial versions of Syrius are fully functioning Beta versions of the Network of Momentum wallet where you can do everything you will be able to do on the Network of Momentum, but in a test phase. All the Zenon ZNN and Quasar QSR coins on Syrius wallet are test versions of the actual NoM coins and are not redeemable for real ZNN or QSR.

The Syrius Wallet will eventually be the go-to wallet on the Network of Momentum once it comes out of Beta testing and goes live at Network Launch ( Alphanet and onwards ).

#### Q. Will smart contracts be part of Alphanet? <a href="q-will-smart-contracts-be-part-of-alphanet" id="q-will-smart-contracts-be-part-of-alphanet"></a>

A. Yes. Initially only the embedded smart contract layer will be available at Alphanet launch.

#### Q. When will cold wallet support be available? <a href="q-when-will-cold-wallet-support-be-available" id="q-when-will-cold-wallet-support-be-available"></a>

A. The implementation for cold wallet support is possible and can be developed after Alphanet launch.

#### Q. I am interested in running a node on the Alphanet. Are there requirements or specifications for what is required in terms of hardware capabilities? <a href="q-i-am-interested-in-running-a-node-on-the-alphanet-are-there-requirements-or-specifications-for-wha" id="q-i-am-interested-in-running-a-node-on-the-alphanet-are-there-requirements-or-specifications-for-wha"></a>

A. Yes the node hardware requirements have already been published for the testnet. It doesn’t mean Alphanet’s will be the same, but you could imagine these as minimum requirements. You can easily achieve these requirements with a cloud vps. https://testnet.znn.space/#!requirements.md

## wZNN <a href="wznn" id="wznn"></a>

#### What is Wrapped ZNN ( wZNN ) <a href="what-is-wrapped-znn-wznn" id="what-is-wrapped-znn-wznn"></a>

The Zenon team created the option to buy and trade a version of ZNN on Pancakeswap on the Binance Smart Chain ( wZNN on BSC ) using a Web.3 wallet like Metamask. You could swap ZNN from your Legacy Wallet on the PIVX chain for wZNN on Binance Smart Chain through a one-way bridge at a cost of 1 ZNN per 100 ZNN swapped. ( Send 100 ZNN, receive 99 wZNN ). You are still able to cross the one-way bridge from your Legacy Wallet to BSC if you want to trade your ZNN on Pancakeswap. wZNN is still active and it seems will remain so into the future as a cross-chain version of ZNN.

#### Can I swap wZNN for ZNN? <a href="can-i-swap-wznn-for-znn" id="can-i-swap-wznn-for-znn"></a>

Once the Zenon Network of Momentum is out of it’s Testnet phase and active ( Alphanet ), you will be able to swap wZNN coins on BSC for ZNN on the Network of Momentum ( NoM ) through a two-way bridge, meaning you can go from ZNN on NoM to wZNN on Binance Smart Chain and back again if you find liquidity is better on Pancakeswap, or want to hold your ZNN as wZNN in Metamask. We don’t yet know what the fees will be to cross that bridge.

#### Q: What is the wZNN token address on BSC? <a href="q-what-is-the-wznn-token-address-on-bsc" id="q-what-is-the-wznn-token-address-on-bsc"></a>

#### Q. Why is there a bridge to Binance Smart Chain versus other chains? <a href="q-why-is-there-a-bridge-to-binance-smart-chain-versus-other-chains" id="q-why-is-there-a-bridge-to-binance-smart-chain-versus-other-chains"></a>

A. BSC was initially chosen to be used for a one-way bridge because of EVM compatibility and low fees, facilitating ease of transfer for buyers and sellers.

#### Q. Will Zenon bridge with other chains like Fantom, ETH or AVAX, similar to the current BSC Bridge? <a href="q-will-zenon-bridge-with-other-chains-like-fantom-eth-or-avax-similar-to-the-current-bsc-bridge" id="q-will-zenon-bridge-with-other-chains-like-fantom-eth-or-avax-similar-to-the-current-bsc-bridge"></a>

A. All EVM chains are compatible with the current Zenon Bridge implementation and can be extended to work two-way after Alphanet launch.

#### Q. What does it mean that the bridge is “one-way”? <a href="q-what-does-it-mean-that-the-bridge-is-one-way" id="q-what-does-it-mean-that-the-bridge-is-one-way"></a>

A. This means that, for now, when you bridge ZNN over to BSC, the coins will remain wrapped (wZNN) on BSC and cannot be sent back to the legacy chain. After Alphanet launch, two-way bridging will be implemented and you can send wrapped coins back to the network for staking and delegation.

#### Q. Can I stake wZNN that I have bought on Pancakeswap? <a href="q-can-i-stake-wznn-that-i-have-bought-on-pancakeswap" id="q-can-i-stake-wznn-that-i-have-bought-on-pancakeswap"></a>

A. No, you can only stake ZNN on the legacy network, and either stake or delegate on Alphanet after it launches. wZNN can be bought, sold, or used for liquidity provision, but cannot be staked.

#### Q. Can I store wZNN in Metamask? <a href="q-can-i-store-wznn-in-metamask" id="q-can-i-store-wznn-in-metamask"></a>

A. Yes, you can send wZNN to any web3 compatible wallet in the same way you would send any other BSC token to it.

#### Q. Can I earn rewards by participating in the liquidity pool for wZNN/BNB? <a href="q-can-i-earn-rewards-by-participating-in-the-liquidity-pool-for-wznnbnb" id="q-can-i-earn-rewards-by-participating-in-the-liquidity-pool-for-wznnbnb"></a>

A. Yes, plasma points are being rewarded daily to liquidity providers based on their share of the LP. This will continue until the end of the incentivized public testnet, and upon Alphanet launch, the $PP tokens will convert into $QSR at a rate of 1000 $PP to 1 $QSR.

## Incentivized Testnet <a href="incentivized-testnet" id="incentivized-testnet"></a>

#### What are Plasma Points ( PP ) ? <a href="what-are-plasma-points-pp" id="what-are-plasma-points-pp"></a>

To drive interest in the project and get people involved a Testnet Syrius wallet was released with an “Incentivization” tab. You were challenged to complete quests and tasks and received Plasma Points ( PP ), the first official token on the Network of Momentum, as reward.

All the PP accrued in your Syrius wallet as rewards have real value. Once the Network of Momentum is launched ( The Big Bang ) You will receive QSR in exchange for your PP at the rate of 1 QSR for every 1000 PP.

#### How can I receive rewards for tasks and generate Plasma Points ( PP ) ? <a href="how-can-i-receive-rewards-for-tasks-and-generate-plasma-points-pp" id="how-can-i-receive-rewards-for-tasks-and-generate-plasma-points-pp"></a>

**Twitter Tasks**

When you connected your Twitter account to the wallet it began to track your activity on Twitter and reward you for completing tasks on Twitter. The rewards arrived in your Syrius wallet in the form of Plasma Points ( PP ). They accrued in your Incentivised tab and are also visible in the Tokens Tab. The Twitter quests are complete and no longer active. More info from Zenon [https://medium.com/@zenon.network/zenon-public-incentivized-testnet-overview-591db5fc9bc9](https://medium.com/@zenon.network/zenon-public-incentivized-testnet-overview-591db5fc9bc9)

**Rewards for testing the Swap Function.** More Incentivized tasks occurred in the form of receiving PP for testing how well the swap function worked from the Legacy Wallet to the Syrius NoM wallet. A snapshot of your Legacy Wallet was taken around the 25th of September 2021 and if you “Test-swapped” your ZNN to the Syrius wallet you were rewarded at a rate of 100 PP for every 1 ZNN you sent across. Your OG ZNN remained safely in your Legacy Wallet, and you received the reward for testing the swap function as PP in your Syrius wallet. If you had ZNN in your Legacy Wallet before 2021 Sep 25 you can still earn PP by doing the Test Swap.

**Pancakeswap Liquidity rewards.** To bump up the liquidity on the Pancakeswap wZNN / BNB pair a liquidity reward program is in place where you receive PP tokens in your Syrius wallet for every day you add liquidity to the wZNN / BNB pool. Be aware that as ZNN begins to climb in value you run the risk of impermanent loss, which can be mitigated a little by only adding to the pool when ZNN is at it’s highest price and removing liquidity when it is at it’s lowest price.

#### How can I partake in the testing phase of Zenon Network of Momentum? <a href="how-can-i-partake-in-the-testing-phase-of-zenon-network-of-momentum" id="how-can-i-partake-in-the-testing-phase-of-zenon-network-of-momentum"></a>

If you have downloaded the Syrius test wallet from the bottom of the official Zenon.network page you can fuel that wallet through a Faucet for tZNN and tQSR.

To test the activity on the network and get things moving you’re able to tap into a Faucet bot on Telegram and request a payout of tZNN and tQSR to your Syrius wallet every 24 hours. You can then use these coins to generate Plasma for feeless, instant transactions, stake, delegate, and set up Pillars and Sentinels like you would on the real Network of Momentum. You can even mint your own tokens : ) So everything can be tested and we can give feedback to the team via the #Feedback hashtag on the official ZENON Telegram channel. The faucet bot is still active.

### SwapDrop <a href="swapdrop" id="swapdrop"></a>

#### Q: Can I still participate in SwapDrop and receive PP rewards? <a href="q-can-i-still-participate-in-swapdrop-and-receive-pp-rewards" id="q-can-i-still-participate-in-swapdrop-and-receive-pp-rewards"></a>

Yes, but only if you had ZNN on a legacy address at block 1,331,331.

For more information about the Swap Drop event see [https://medium.com/@zenon.network/swapdrop-event-october-1st-bd99964589aa](https://medium.com/@zenon.network/swapdrop-event-october-1st-bd99964589aa)

#### Q: Does participating in SwapDrop affect the ZNN in my legacy wallet? <a href="q-does-participating-in-swapdrop-affect-the-znn-in-my-legacy-wallet" id="q-does-participating-in-swapdrop-affect-the-znn-in-my-legacy-wallet"></a>

No.

SwapDrop is an incentivized test for the real swap for Alphanet. As stated at: [https://medium.com/@zenon.network/swapdrop-event-october-1st-bd99964589aa](https://medium.com/@zenon.network/swapdrop-event-october-1st-bd99964589aa)

> The legacy assets (ZNN and QSR, if applicable) will be swapped into testnet coins (tZNN and tQSR, if applicable) without affecting the legacy network balances.

## Legacy Network <a href="legacy-network" id="legacy-network"></a>

#### Q. Where are some good sources of information to familiarize myself with the project? <a href="q-where-are-some-good-sources-of-information-to-familiarize-myself-with-the-project" id="q-where-are-some-good-sources-of-information-to-familiarize-myself-with-the-project"></a>

A. A community member compiled a lot of various info from other articles into one big article, “The Ape’s Guide to the Galaxy”. This is a great initial read to familiarize yourself with the project. Then you can dig into more details via the team’s medium articles or asking specific questions of the community in the official Telegram channel. Links are provided below: https://shazzamazzash.medium.com/zenon-network-an-apes-guide-to-the-galaxy-7aad7dacdfef https://medium.com/@zenon.network

#### Q. What’s the difference between the legacy network and the Alphanet? <a href="q-whats-the-difference-between-the-legacy-network-and-the-alphanet" id="q-whats-the-difference-between-the-legacy-network-and-the-alphanet"></a>

A. The legacy network is a placeholder chain that allowed the network to decentralize while the Network of Momentum was being built. Upon Alphanet launch the legacy network will still exist but mostly to facilitate holders moving their coins to Alphanet. At that point, the legacy network’s coins will no longer be traded on exchanges.

#### Q. I downloaded the Legacy wallet but it didn’t make me create a recovery phrase, why? <a href="q-i-downloaded-the-legacy-wallet-but-it-didnt-make-me-create-a-recovery-phrase-why" id="q-i-downloaded-the-legacy-wallet-but-it-didnt-make-me-create-a-recovery-phrase-why"></a>

A. The legacy wallet doesn’t use recovery phases, if you back up a copy of your wallet.dat file it contains your private key however.

#### Q. Once the Swap Cycle begins from Legacy to Syrius, would the staking continue on legacy wallet? <a href="q-once-the-swap-cycle-begins-from-legacy-to-syrius-would-the-staking-continue-on-legacy-wallet" id="q-once-the-swap-cycle-begins-from-legacy-to-syrius-would-the-staking-continue-on-legacy-wallet"></a>

A. No, staking will commence on the Alphanet and cease on the legacy network. To continue staking, you will need to migrate your coins to the Alphanet via a swap mechanism (more details on this to be announced soon).

#### Q. Is there an issue if I am delayed in swapping my coins over to Alphanet? Can I leave the coins in the legacy wallet without an issue. <a href="q-is-there-an-issue-if-i-am-delayed-in-swapping-my-coins-over-to-alphanet-can-i-leave-the-coins-in-t" id="q-is-there-an-issue-if-i-am-delayed-in-swapping-my-coins-over-to-alphanet-can-i-leave-the-coins-in-t"></a>

A. You theoretically can leave your coins in the legacy wallet, but there is a decay mechanism built into the Alphanet swap which penalizes you for delaying swapping over to the new network. Eventually the legacy network will be unsupported by most network participants, so everyone is encouraged to swap over as soon as it becomes possible.
