# FAQ

General

**Has there been a private sale?**&#x20;

No - ZNN was distributed through a lockdrop to those who staked BTC and ran a node for a year or longer. The BTC was returned.

**What is the initial circulating supply?**&#x20;

Total supply of ZNN after 1 year is 8 052 917. More info [here](https://medium.com/@zenon.network/znn-x-qsr-alphanet-specifications-83d27c005c09).

**What is NoM 0 ?**&#x20;

NoM 0 is the first stage of the Network of Momentum. It will last approximately 1 year.

**Is there an explorer for the NoM?**&#x20;

The Testnet explorer has not been ported over to the Mainnet as yet.

**What is a Momentum?**&#x20;

A Momentum is similar to a block in a regular blockchain, but it comprises information from both the DAG layer and the Block Lattice layer. This published package of information from the two layers of the NoM is called a Momentum and like a block in the Bitcoin chain, it is tamper-proof and irreversible once published.

**Is Zenon Network really Fee-less?**&#x20;

Yes. You do however need to fuse QSR to the transaction address to drive zero-fee transactions. That QSR can be un-fused at any time with no loss of QSR.

**How can I support the Network?**&#x20;

The most direct way is to run your own node. The node is very light and uses about 10% of the cpu power of Syrius. More info [here.](more-information/nodes-pillars-and-sentinels.md)

**I want to run a node, where do I start?**&#x20;

The [Nodes Information page](more-information/nodes-pillars-and-sentinels.md) will get you going.

**What are some good sources of information to familiarise myself with the project?**&#x20;

Both Community Articles and Official articles are linked [here](broken-reference).

**Will Zenon bridge with chains like Fantom, ETH or AVAX, similar to the current BSC Bridge?**&#x20;

All EVM chains are compatible with the Zenon Bridge implementation and can be extended to work two-way after Alphanet launch.

**What will be the program language for Alphanet? Will it be the same for both coins and the token?**&#x20;

The code is written in Go, but SDKs will be provided for the most popular programming languages.

### Wallets

**Where can I download a wallet?**

Wallet downloads are linked on the official website [here.](https://zenon.network/#downloads)

**In which wallets can I store ZNN?**&#x20;

ZNN can be stored in the Syrius Wallet. Wrapped ZNN can be stored in any Web.3 wallet like Metamask.

**Is there a mobile wallet for Zenon?**&#x20;

Not as yet. Zenon Network will release a mobile wallet and Community developed mobile wallets are being built.

**Can I store ZNN in a hardware wallet?**

ZNN is a new protocol and as such is not yet supported in hardware wallets. You can however store wZNN in a hardware wallet.

**My wallet keeps disconnecting, why?**

The RPC node your Syrius wallet is connected to is congested. You can change the RPC node your wallet is using. [More info here.](more-information/nodes-pillars-and-sentinels.md#nodes-syrius-and-the-network) Also consider [creating your own node.](getting-started.md#run-your-own-node-if-you-can)

**I have the Error "Wallet Unlock Failed" what can I do?**

Community members have linked to fixes[ here.](./#community-resources)

**I have no Plasma for transactions, what now?**

You can do slow transactions using PoW; your computer will do some work to get the transaction through.

There are ways to get free Plasma for the short term. [Info here.](more-information/fees-and-plasma.md)

**How do I swap my Legacy ZNN to Syrius?**

The [Swap to Alphanet page](more-information/swap-to-alphanet.md) has all that information.

### Feeless transacting

**How do I get Plasma for sending fee-less transactions?**&#x20;

You need at least 20 QSR to generate Plasma. 120 QSR gives full Plasma power. 50 QSR is recommended for the Legacy swap from the old network to the new. Fuse the QSR in the Plasma tab of the Syrius wallet. The QSR can be unfused at any time with no loss.

There are ways to get free Plasma for the short term. [Info here.](more-information/fees-and-plasma.md)

### Staking & Delegating

**What is the difference between staking and delegating?**

In delegating you add ZNN voting weight to a Pillar and receive rewards in ZNN. You can undelegate at any time.

In staking you stake ZNN for QSR, your ZNN are locked for a minimum of 1 month and you can claim your QSR daily.

**How do I delegate to a Pillar and receive rewards in Syrius?**

You do that within the Pillars tab of the Syrius wallet. More info [here.](more-information/staking-and-incentives.md)

**What is the staking return?**&#x20;

Delegating to a Node has an APY of up to 72% Staking ZNN for QSR has an APY of up to 26%.  These figures are dependent on fluctuating conditions. Figures shown are from the [Zenon.Network](https://zenon.network/#downloads) page.

**I received Quasar QSR, what can I do with it?**&#x20;

It will be possible to swap QSR for ZNN within the Syrius Wallet soon. It can also be used to generate Plasma for zero fee transactions.

### **wZNN ( wrapped ZNN )**

**What is wZNN?**&#x20;

The Zenon team created the option to buy and trade a version of ZNN on Pancakeswap on the Binance Smart Chain ( wZNN on BSC ) using a Web.3 wallet like Metamask. wZNN will remain as a cross-chain version of ZNN and have price parity.

**Can I store wZNN in Metamask?**&#x20;

Yes. wZNN is a BSC token that can be stored in any compatible Web.3 wallet.

**Can I store wZNN in a hardware wallet?**&#x20;

Yes, wZNN is a BSC token and as such can be stored in a Ledger or Trezor wallet.

**What is the new wZNN contract address?**&#x20;

Token contract address: 0x84b174628911896a3b87fa6980d05dbc2ee74836

**What is the contract address for the wZNN BNB liquidity pool on Pancakeswap?**&#x20;

Liquidity Pool contract address: 0xE6B03fCB16dAf3462DdfB8B0AFb3F0E87d38d884

**Can I swap my ZNN for wZNN?**&#x20;

A bridge between Syrius and BSC will be opened after Alphanet.

**Can I stake wZNN that I bought on Pancakeswap?**&#x20;

No - wZNN cannot be staked. Passive income can be earned by adding liquidity to the Pancakeswap pool and receiving rewards in your Syrius Wallet.

**Is wZNN part of the total supply of ZNN?**&#x20;

Yes - wZNN is created by burning ZNN at the bridge, it does not dilute the total supply of ZNN.

**Why can I not see the wZNN in my Web.3 wallet?**&#x20;

Make sure you have the correct contract address. In your Web.3 wallet under BSC add the token address 0x84b174628911896a3b87fa6980d05dbc2ee74836.

**Why is there a bridge to Binance Smart Chain versus other chains?**&#x20;

BSC was initially chosen to be used for a one-way bridge because of EVM compatibility and low fees, facilitating ease of transfer for buyers and sellers.

### Legacy ZNN

**Can I keep the Legacy ZNN in my Legacy Wallet after the new network has launched?**

Legacy ZNN are safe in the Legacy Wallet but need to be swapped over to the NoM. Penalties for late swap are incurred 3 months after Alphanet launch.

**I left my ZNN on an exchange, what will happen to them?**&#x20;

It is entirely up to the Exchanges to honour your purchase of Legacy ZNN and swap them out for NoM ZNN.

**Must I do something to swap to the new Network?**&#x20;

Yes - you will have to swap the Legacy ZNN over to your Syrius Wallet yourself. [More info here.](more-information/swap-to-alphanet.md)
