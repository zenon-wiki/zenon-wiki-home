# Staking & Incentives

### Testnet Syrius Rewards

#### What are Plasma Points ( PP ) ? <a href="what-are-plasma-points-pp" id="what-are-plasma-points-pp"></a>

To drive interest in the project and get people involved a Testnet Syrius wallet was released with an “Incentivization” tab. You were challenged to complete quests and tasks and received Plasma Points ( PP ), the first official token on the Network of Momentum, as reward.

All the PP accrued in your Syrius wallet as rewards have real value. Once the Network of Momentum is launched ( The Big Bang ) You will receive QSR in exchange for your PP at the rate of 1 QSR for every 1000 PP.

All Testnet rewards in the form of PP are now complete.

#### Can I still participate in SwapDrop and receive PP rewards? <a href="q-can-i-still-participate-in-swapdrop-and-receive-pp-rewards" id="q-can-i-still-participate-in-swapdrop-and-receive-pp-rewards"></a>

Yes, but only up until the evening of November 18 2021 and if you had ZNN on a Legacy address at block 1,331,331 ( On or before September 30 2021 )

#### Does participating in SwapDrop affect the ZNN in my legacy wallet? <a href="q-does-participating-in-swapdrop-affect-the-znn-in-my-legacy-wallet" id="q-does-participating-in-swapdrop-affect-the-znn-in-my-legacy-wallet"></a>

No. The legacy assets (ZNN and QSR, if applicable) will be swapped into testnet coins (tZNN and tQSR, if applicable) without affecting the legacy network balances.

SwapDrop was an incentivized test for the real swap for Alphanet and is no longer possible.

### BSC wZNN Rewards

#### Can I stake wZNN that I have bought on Pancakeswap? <a href="q-can-i-stake-wznn-that-i-have-bought-on-pancakeswap" id="q-can-i-stake-wznn-that-i-have-bought-on-pancakeswap"></a>

No, you can only stake ZNN on the Legacy network, and either stake or delegate on Alphanet after it launches. wZNN can be bought, sold, or used for liquidity provision, but cannot be staked.

#### Can I earn rewards by participating in the liquidity pool for wZNN/BNB? <a href="q-can-i-earn-rewards-by-participating-in-the-liquidity-pool-for-wznnbnb" id="q-can-i-earn-rewards-by-participating-in-the-liquidity-pool-for-wznnbnb"></a>

Yes, plasma points are being rewarded daily to liquidity providers based on their share of the LP. This will continue until the end of the incentivized public testnet, and upon Alphanet launch, the $PP tokens will convert into $QSR at a rate of 1000 $PP to 1 $QSR.

**Pancakeswap Liquidity rewards.**&#x20;

To bump up the liquidity on the Pancakeswap wZNN / BNB pair a liquidity reward program is in place where you receive PP tokens in your Syrius wallet for every day you add liquidity to the wZNN / BNB pool. Be aware that as ZNN begins to climb in value you run the risk of impermanent loss, which can be mitigated a little by only adding to the pool when ZNN is at it’s highest price and removing liquidity when it is at it’s lowest price.&#x20;

### Legacy Wallet Staking

If you chose to store the PIVX Zennies you bought through a CEX or OTC in the Legacy Wallet you were able to stake your coins for rewards, which arrived as 0.9 ZNN, at intervals depending on the size of your stake and the duration of your wallet being online. ( Hot staking ). Very broadly the rewards were about 0.9 ZNN per 1000 ZNN staked and online per day. This program is still running, but rewards seem to be slowing down. It will end when the Alphanet launches.

#### Once the Swap Cycle begins from Legacy to Syrius, would the staking continue on legacy wallet? <a href="q-once-the-swap-cycle-begins-from-legacy-to-syrius-would-the-staking-continue-on-legacy-wallet" id="q-once-the-swap-cycle-begins-from-legacy-to-syrius-would-the-staking-continue-on-legacy-wallet"></a>

No, staking will commence on the Alphanet and cease on the legacy network. To continue staking, you will need to migrate your coins to the Alphanet via a swap mechanism (more details on this to be announced soon).
