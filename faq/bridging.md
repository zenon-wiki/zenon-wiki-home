# Bridging

#### Can I bridge from the Legacy Wallet to Binance Smart Chain?

This is no longer possible. The Legacy chain has ended and all ZNN in the snapshot at block 1.405.000 which occured on 22nd November 2021 are eligible to swap across to the Alphanet.

Once the Zenon Network of Momentum is out of it’s Testnet phase and active ( Alphanet ), you will be able to swap wZNN coins on BSC for ZNN on the Network of Momentum ( NoM ) through a two-way bridge, meaning you can go from ZNN on NoM to wZNN on Binance Smart Chain and back again if you find liquidity is better on Pancakeswap, or want to hold your ZNN as wZNN in Metamask. We don’t yet know what the fees will be to cross that bridge.

#### Why is there a bridge to Binance Smart Chain versus other chains? <a href="q-why-is-there-a-bridge-to-binance-smart-chain-versus-other-chains" id="q-why-is-there-a-bridge-to-binance-smart-chain-versus-other-chains"></a>

BSC was initially chosen to be used for a one-way bridge because of EVM compatibility and low fees, facilitating ease of transfer for buyers and sellers.

#### Will Zenon bridge with other chains like Fantom, ETH or AVAX, similar to the current BSC Bridge? <a href="q-will-zenon-bridge-with-other-chains-like-fantom-eth-or-avax-similar-to-the-current-bsc-bridge" id="q-will-zenon-bridge-with-other-chains-like-fantom-eth-or-avax-similar-to-the-current-bsc-bridge"></a>

All EVM chains are compatible with the current Zenon Bridge implementation and can be extended to work two-way after Alphanet launch.
