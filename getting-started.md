### Download Syrius wallet - now with embedded node.

Launch Syrius - Save Mnemonic phrase and created password.&#x20;

In the Settings tab ⚙ > bottom left > Nodes, select 'Embedded Node' and tap 'confirm'. A fresh launch starting at the first block ( Momentum 1 ) will take approx 3 - 4 hours to fully sync. Do not attempt any transactions before a full sync.

### Option to download and launch a seperate node if desired.

Run the seperate node and point your Syrius wallet to the independent node. Guide for doing that by community member Muzzo here:
