#### Why are Pillars and Sentinels so expensive?

The Network of Momentum probably wouldn’t perform very well if nodes didn’t have stable uptimes and could join/leave at will. This is currently an issue with Lightning and why it ends up being more centralized than we would like. High collateral is skin in the game to prevent that. The high price of buy-in also constitutes as COLLATERAL, meaning possible punitive actions for bad behaviour. Especially when we start talking about BTC interoperability.

Having a stable set of nodes is important for each step of a transaction. Every transaction has to be sent to a sentinel who then has to send to other sentinels before sending to a pillar. Pillars use virtual voting for consensus which also need a relatively stable voting set.

The NoM is not like BTC where we can randomly send to any node and receive blocks every 10 minutes. Momentums are much faster.

#### What is a Momentum?

A Momentum on the Network of Momentum is similar to a block in a regular blockchain, but due to the Dual-layer design of the NoM, each published ‘block’ is in fact a collection of blocks of information; some from the DAG layer, and some from the Block-lattice transaction layer. This published package of information from the two layers of the NoM is called a Momentum and like a block in the Bitcoin chain, it is tamper-proof and irreversible once published.

#### How does Plasma secure the network and make transactions Fee-less?

Plasma is created by ‘fusing’ the second coin of the NoM, Quasar, in your Syrius wallet under the ‘Plasma’ tab. You fuse Quasar for Plasma for each address you will be transacting from. ( They have to be done individually with Quasar sent to each address. ) This locks the Quasar to the address and forms a Proof of Stake, at the same time creating the energy to fuel transactions.

So in a way you do have to pay for transactions by buying and fusing Quasar, but that Quasar can be unfused at any time after an initial short lock time and is not depleted through the action of creating Plasma. The Quasar/QSR you put in to fuse is what you get back when you un-fuse. The Plasma generated through fusing is algorithmically determined to ensure the network stays stable and cannot be spammed - there will never be enough plasma in the network to congest it. Everyone only gets a portion of the throughput depending on how much QSR is staked.

The PoW is apparently very difficult so its effects are negligible. "
