# Delegating Staking & Rewards

#### **Delegating and staking on the Network of Momentum**

Delegating and staking is done in the Syrius wallet.&#x20;

You **delegate** the ZNN in an address through the Pillar tab in the wallet and receive **rewards in ZNN**. You can undelegate at any time.&#x20;

You **stake** the ZNN in an address through the Staking tab in the wallet and receive **rewards in QSR**. The ZNN are locked for the staking period you have chosen and you can claim your QSR daily.&#x20;

You can split your ZNN between delegating and staking. The ZNN you stake are subtracted from the ZNN delegated. You cannot delegate the ZNN you have already staked. You can transact as per normal - your delegated weight adjusts according to the balance of your wallet.

### Delegating

**Delegating is part of Governance on the NoM**&#x20;

Giving voting weight to a Pillar in exchange for rewards is one of the fundamental governance mechanisms on the NoM. In the future you will be able to vote for things on the Network by shifting your ZNN to a Pillar who’s proposal you like.&#x20;

Pillars receive rewards for running the Network and being core validators. Those rewards come in the form of Delegator rewards and Momentum rewards. The Pillar can choose how much of those rewards they pass on to their delegators and can entice delegators to move to their PIllar by increasing rewards. This incentivised decentralisation creates a dynamic play between the Pillars and the delegators, and helps create a healthy, sustainable economy.

#### Tips for **delegating**.&#x20;

* Rewards arrive once every 24 hr epoch at approx 2pm UTC.&#x20;
* You can change your delegation during an epoch without losing rewards.
* You can delegate to more pillars by moving funds to another address and delegating from that address. Shift focus to the new address by highlighting it in the Settings tab.
* It is easier to collect rewards with Plasma available. [More info here.](fees-and-plasma.md)
* You can turn off your computer once you have delegated.
* If you claim your delegating rewards each day they compound.
* A pillar can change rewards to zero, but they cannot touch your delegated ZNN.

#### **Pillar tracking tools**&#x20;

The community is building tools to track Pillar rewards:&#x20;

Vilkris has built a [Pillar tracker channel on Telegram](https://t.me/pillar\_tracker).

Alien Valley Pillar have created a [Pillar Tracker.](http://alien-valley.io/who-to-delegate.html)

Zenon Tools have created a [Staking toolbox](https://zenon.tools).

### **Staking**

Staking is Simple. In the Syrius wallet staking tab select how much ZNN you want to stake and for how long. **Your ZNN are locked** for the period you selected and cannot be spent or moved. Staking for longer than 6 months increases the rewards significantly.

You cannot delegate the ZNN you have staked.

You can turn off your computer once you have staked.

You stake ZNN so that you can receive QSR to bond to an address for Plasma and zero fee transactions. It will also be tradeable in the future.

### **Expected returns**&#x20;

Delegating to a Pillar has an APY of up to 72%. Staking ZNN for QSR has an APY of up to 26%.  These figures are dependent on fluctuating conditions. Figures shown are from the Zenon Network page.

#### **Zenon rewards calculator for Staking and Delegating.**

There is a rewards slider on the Zenon website. Scroll up a bit from the downloads section to access it.

**Liquidity Pool rewards**

To bump up the liquidity on the Pancakeswap wZNN / BNB pair a liquidity reward program will be activated soon where you receive QSR tokens in your Syrius wallet for every day you add liquidity to the wZNN / BNB pool.&#x20;

Those who had linked their Syrius address to the previous reward program will retroactively be rewarded for providing liquidity. [More info here.](https://twitter.com/Zenon\_Network/status/1463265853328162820)

Be aware that as ZNN begins to climb in value you run the risk of impermanent loss, which can be mitigated a little by only adding to the pool when ZNN is at it’s highest price and removing liquidity when it is at it’s lowest price. More info about wZNN here.

**How do I add liquidity to the wZNN / BNB pool on Pancakeswap?**

Rufus has put together a guide [here.](https://medium.com/@rufusizthebezt/zenon-liquidity-program-how-to-add-liquidity-on-pancakeswap-75894da9949b)

**Can I stake wZNN that I have bought on Pancakeswap?**&#x20;

No, you can only stake or delegate ZNN in the Syrius Wallet. wZNN can be bought, sold, or used for liquidity provision, but cannot be staked.

### **Legacy Wallet Staking**&#x20;

Staking on the Legacy wallet ended at the Snapshot taken November 22 2021. If you left your legacy wallet running after the snapshot those new rewards do not count and will not be transferred to Syrius when you swap.
