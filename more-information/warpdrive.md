## Judge Nominees

(alphabetical)

### Apu (Non-Voting Honorary Counsel)

When allo? [@ZNNapu](https://twitter.com/ZNNapu)

### Crypto Nut

Crypto Nut is a crypto investor and well-known personality on crypto Twitter. He discovered Zenon in 2019 and has been a member of the community ever since. As a potential member of the WarpDrive judging panel, he brings his experience in evaluating crypto projects for the past several years, which has resulted in an overall 58000% portfolio gain so far.

### Dece

Green pilled & solving riddles with you lot since 2019. Ear to the ground with the community. Co-Founder of two successful companies. Coding experience (mainly python). Invested in many projects, can recognise value (as can we all in Zenon). As bullish as they come on this project. Want to see Zenon succeed.

As a judge I'll be looking for plays along the following lines... Anything that helps others get ideas off the ground. Projects that foster community involvement. Projects that help portability of existing ecosystems into Zenon. Broadly, I'll be listening to you and incorporating the ideas you have around the various submissions to help land in line with community think.

I'll be suggesting a couple of ideas myself to get community involvement / thought experimenting around them.

### Dumeril

I'm holder and part of the community since 2019. My background is in computer sciences; I'm currently an active developer and software architect. As part of the Zenina team during the first incubator phase, I built and maintained the original discord bot. More recently, I built an indexer for the legacy network ([https://github.com/dumeriz/block-parser](https://github.com/dumeriz/block-parser)).

I know it's difficult to define a project for warp drive without full knowledge of the coming network, so I think as judges, we should acknowledge that and don't be too strict. However, a project should have a clear idea about its general architecture, possible shortcomings and a realistic development time horizon. It should show an understanding of the links and facilities an upcoming decentralized mainnet must provide for successful execution. That's what I would be looking for mainly as a judge. Nevertheless, a great idea and / or team can offset a lot of defects in early planning in the long run.

### George

* Relatively new to crypto/Zenon but already feel the weight of my bags
* Creator/maintainer of [https://zenon.wiki](https://zenon.wiki)
* Helping to coordinate WarpDrive voting and community dev efforts
* Academic background in math and make computers go brrrrrrrrr for work
* Zenon is a nascent ecosystem. As a judge, I will look for projects which can serve as the long term buildings blocks for others to create applications on top of

### Kemal

Derpy cat has been a Zenon maxi since 2019. People know him as Kemalitto, he likes to live off of his staking rewards. Doesn't know much technical stuff himself but can perfectly understand who does. Good gem hunter, capable of choosing what's best for NoM.

### Legenddawg

@legenddawg has been a Zenon community member since November 2019 and created the Sigli as a Symbol NFT project ([https://sigli.space/](https://sigli.space)) as well as an educational ZNN website ([https://znn.so/](https://znn.so)). Outside of being an alien, legenddawg is the co-founder and CEO of a small software company despite being non-technical.

### Muzzo

Hello there, I'm Muzzo. Commonly known as ZNN Alien on Twitter and YouTube. I have been involved with Zenon since Q4 2019. Member of the Zenon awareness squadron, since its inception.

Aside from publishing multiple YouTube videos about ZNN and tutorials on staking etc, I have been actively helping people with their queries.

My professional career started from Banking as an Analyst, and now I'm a GM of an conglomerate in Far East Asia.

I'm well diversified within multiple crypto projects, (as there's no 1 winner here) analysing their fundamentals and investing for the long run.

With 360Â° experience, I'm certain that I would be a good judge selecting the ideal projects.

### Node c

Maths background, prev work building data models, data analytics and interpretation. Recent yrs been enjoying blockchain analytics as a hobby.

Community member since 2019, joined for the node rewards, missed the xstakes era, intrigued by the no upfront raise.

Have experience investing in altcoins for 4+ yrs by evaluating different project by tokenomics and still learning/testing the technical side of projects on the go.

### Rex

I am a longtime community member and employed in a research field. I have some bit of a technical capability but also have been investing and participating in crypto since 2015, and have seen the evolution of projects since then. I mostly want to evaluate these projects as they relate to fostering incremental utility on NoM after it launches, and nurturing further use cases. We need tools and utilities built, and things that can be foundational to attracting other developers and projects to Zenon. Thanks for your consideration!

### Sashounet

* Crypto & more importantly Zenon-passioned
* Launched one startup and two online shops
* Participated in the creation of a handful of tokens in the crypto space
* Solid marketing skills
