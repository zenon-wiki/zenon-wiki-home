# Swap to Alphanet

**Tips for a smooth swap**

* The Syrius wallet dashboard indicates how many days are left before swap penalties occur.
* You can use Legacy wallet version 1.6.4 or 1.6.5.
* Create a fresh wallet.dat backup on your desktop. File > Backup > Save as
* You need a clean installation of the latest Syrius wallet.
* Download the [Alphanet Syrius](https://zenon.network/#downloads) wallet to a new folder and extract all the files before launching it. Check that it is called ' s y r i u s ' and not ' syrius '.
* Use your 12 or 24 word Mnemonic from testnet Syrius (if you have one) to launch the new wallet.
* You can get your Syrius Mnemonic in Settings. Scroll down > Backup > Dump Mnemonic
* Make sure the Syrius wallet points to a fast node. Info on that [here](nodes-pillars-and-sentinels.md#nodes-syrius-and-the-network)
* You can use PoW to do the transfer without Plasma, but it's not ideal.
* Fuel your wallet with Plasma to ensure a smooth transfer from Legacy into Syrius, free Plasma is available. Info on that [here.](fees-and-plasma.md)
* The swap function is in Syrius > Settings Tab > Wallet Options > Swap Wallet.
* It is recommended to send each Legacy address to 'Address 1' in Syrius.
* In the swap wallet process make sure to click the transfer arrows next to each address in Syrius and receive a confirmation tick next to that address before you tap 'Finish'
* Follow the video tutorials for reassurance.
* The balance of your Legacy wallet will not change, but you will receive your funds in your Syrius wallet.
* In Syrius go to the Settings tab > add addresses to show the list of all addresses.

**I have the “old” ZNN, are they safe in the Legacy wallet?**

You may safely store you PIVX ZNN in the Legacy wallet during the transition to the Network of Momentum and transfer at will to the Alphanet. You have a 3 month time window after Alphanet launch to transfer without penalty, after that penalties begin to apply. The Syrius wallet dashboard shows you how many days left before swap penalties occur.

**Swap Decay.**

The first swap cycle will last for 3 months with a Swap Ratio of 1:1. The next cycles until the end of the swap process will last 1 month each. Beginning with Swap Cycle 2, the Swap Ratio will progressively decrease each cycle by 10% until it reaches 0: after the last swap cycle is completed, it won’t be possible to swap coins from the Legacy Network anymore. We decided to triple the period for the first cycle compared to the other cycles in order to give our participants sufficient time to complete the swap without any penalties.

#### **My ZNN were still on an Exchange after the transition to NoM. What happens now?**

It is entirely up to the Exchanges ( who are part of the snapshot ) to honour your purchase of Legacy ZNN and swap them out for NoM ZNN.

If you’re not willing to take that risk it is safer to buy wZNN.
