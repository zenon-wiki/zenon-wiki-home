# Fees & Plasma

#### **How do I get Plasma for sending fee-less transactions?**

1. Generate Plasma using QSR you have in your wallet already.
2. Request that a friend fuses QSR to your transacting address from their wallet.
3. Request temporary Plasma from a Telegram bot like @alien\_valley\_plasma\_bot

**Generating Plasma**

In the Plasma tab in Syrius select the address you want to generate Plasma for, select the amount of QSR you want to fuse to that address and click 'Fuse'. If you have no Plasma yet a PoW is done to fuel the process. The QSR is fused for a minimum of 10 hours after which you can un-fuse at any time with no loss.

You need to fuse QSR to each address you transact from. You can do that from your main address Plasma Tab and select any other address in the address field ( right click to paste an address copied to your clipboard )

A minimum of 20 QSR is recommended and 120 QSR fused gives you full Plasma power. You need at least 50 QSR fused to [do the swap](swap-to-alphanet.md) from Legacy wallet to Syrius.

**You are also able to request that a friend fuses QSR to your transacting address from their wallet.**&#x20;

Just ask them to input your address into their Plasma tab when they fuse. ( right click in the address field to paste from clipboard )

**Where can I get QSR?**

To get QSR you can stake ZNN for QSR in the staking tab ( 1 month minimum lock-in ). You will also be able to swap ZNN for QSR within the Syrius Wallet soon.
