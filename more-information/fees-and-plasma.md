# Fees & Plasma

#### **How do I get Plasma for sending fee-less transactions?**

Once the Alphanet is live ZNN can be swapped for QSR within the Syrius Wallet. In turn that QSR can be sent to any address you are using for transactions and fused to that Address in the Plasma tab of the Syrius wallet. A sum of 10 QSR should be fine to normal activity.&#x20;

When you fuse the QSR to the Address a small PoW is done to fuel that action. The Plasma indicator for that Address will change colour to indicate if you have created sufficient Plasma for fee-free transactions ( Red / Orange / Green )

You need to fuse QSR to each address you transact from.

The QSR can be released if required and no QSR is lost through fusing.

You need QSR to generate Plasma. In the Plasma tab in Syrius select the address you want to generate Plasma for, select the amount of QSR you want to fuse to that address ( minimum of 20 QSR recommended ) and click 'Fuse'. If you have no Plasma yet a PoW is done to fuel the process. The QSR can be unfused at any time with no loss.
