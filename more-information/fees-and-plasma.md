# Fees & Plasma

#### **How do I get Plasma for sending fee-less transactions?**

You need QSR to generate Plasma.&#x20;

To get QSR you can stake ZNN for QSR in the staking tab ( 1 month minimum lock-in ). You will also be able to swap ZNN for QSR within the Syrius Wallet soon.

In the Plasma tab in Syrius select the address you want to generate Plasma for, select the amount of QSR you want to fuse to that address and click 'Fuse'. If you have no Plasma yet a PoW is done to fuel the process. The QSR can be unfused at any time with no loss.

You need to fuse QSR to each address you transact from.

A minimum of 20 QSR is recommended and 120 QSR fused gives you full Plasma power.

**You are also able to request that a friend fuses QSR to your transacting address from their wallet.**&#x20;

Just ask them to input your address into their Plasma tab when they fuse.
