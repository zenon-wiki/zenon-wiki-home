# Alphanet NoM

**The Alphanet is Live.**

The fully functioning first version of the Network of Momentum: **NoM 0** or **Alphanet**, is live with validators being deployed by the community daily to secure the network as it expands and as holders of Legacy ZNN swap over to the NoM. The central wallet for the NoM is the Syrius wallet. More info [here](wallets.md). Delegation and Staking within the Syrius wallet are active, and zero fee transactions through Plasma are also active.&#x20;

This means that transfer of funds, signing of smart contracts and collection of Delegation and Staking rewards are all zero fee.

**These elements of the NoM are live:**

* Scalability and speed through the block lattice transaction layer
* Security and stability through the DAG layer
* Fee-less transactions through Plasma
* Delegating ZNN for rewards in ZNN ( apy is \~ 75% )
* Staking ZNN for rewards in QSR ( apy is \~ 30% )
* In-wallet creation of Tokens with zero coding knowledge
* Creation of personal RPC nodes for security and decentralisation.
* Creation of Pillars as core validators of the Network ( rewarded )
* Creation of Sentinels as supporting validators of the network ( rewarded )
* Strongly incentivised decentralisation.
* Low energy consumption to maintain and secure the NoM

Wrapped ZNN on the Binance Smart Chain is also active and rewards liquidity providers to the wZNN / BNB trading pool in QSR, which are sent to your Syrius wallet.

**These elements of the NoM are in development:**

* EVM cross-chain compatibility
* A bridge between the Syrius wallet and Binance Smart Chain
* Native integration of Bitcoin in the Syrius wallet through Taproot
* A platform to unlock new possibilities for apps ( zApps )
* A platform for the creation of NFT’s

**Will smart contracts be part of Alphanet?**

Yes. Initially only the embedded smart contract layer will be available at Alphanet launch.

**The Coinmetrics for Zenon Network of Momentum.**

**I am interested in running a node on the Alphanet. Is there information on what is required in terms of hardware capabilities?**

Yes the node hardware requirements have already been published for the Testnet. It doesn’t mean Alphanet’s will be the same, but you could imagine these as minimum requirements. You can easily achieve these requirements with a cloud vps.
