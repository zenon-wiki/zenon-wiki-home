# Legacy Network

#### **Where are some good sources of information to familiarize myself with the project?** <a href="q-where-are-some-good-sources-of-information-to-familiarize-myself-with-the-project" id="q-where-are-some-good-sources-of-information-to-familiarize-myself-with-the-project"></a>

A community member compiled a lot of info from other articles into one big article; “The Ape’s Guide to the Galaxy”. This is a great initial read to familiarize yourself with the project. Then you can dig into more details via the team’s medium articles or asking specific questions of the community in the official Telegram channel. Links are provided below:

#### **What’s the difference between the Legacy Network and the Alphanet?** <a href="q-whats-the-difference-between-the-legacy-network-and-the-alphanet" id="q-whats-the-difference-between-the-legacy-network-and-the-alphanet"></a>

The legacy network is a placeholder chain that allowed the network to decentralize while the Network of Momentum was being built. Upon Alphanet launch the legacy network will still exist but mostly to facilitate holders moving their coins to Alphanet. At that point, the legacy network’s coins will no longer be traded on exchanges.

#### **I have the “old” ZNN, what happens with them?** <a href="i-have-the-old-znn-what-happens-with-them" id="i-have-the-old-znn-what-happens-with-them"></a>

You may safely store you PIVX ZNN in the Legacy wallet during the transition to the Network of Momentum and transfer at will to the new network once it launches. You have a 3 month time window to transfer without penalty, after that penalties begin to apply.

More information on swapping Legacy ZNN for the NoM ZNN is available [here.](swap-to-alphanet.md)

#### **Legacy ZNN on Exchanges after the transition to NoM.**

For all those who have bought legacy ZNN on the CEX’s ( Central Exchanges ) and who did not move them into their own Legacy Wallet for the snapshot on November 22 2021, or who trade and buy Legacy ZNN on an exchange after the Snapshot:

It is entirely up to the Exchanges ( who are part of the snapshot ) to honour your purchase of Legacy ZNN and swap them out for NoM ZNN.

If you’re not willing to take that risk it is safer to buy wZNN.
