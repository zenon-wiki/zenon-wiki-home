# Coins & Tokens

Zenon Network runs on two coins. Zenon/ZNN for transactions and Quasar/QSR which is bonded to an address to create Plasma for zero-fee transactions, and burned or bonded in the creation of Pillars and Sentinels.

It is possible to mint tokens on Zenon Network within the Syrius wallet with no coding knowledge. ZNN is burned in the process of creating a token. Note that there can be multiple tokens with the same name, but no token can copy ZNN or QSR. Watch out for Pillars and Communities creating tokens to incentivize participation and backing. All forms of value can be tokenized on Zenon Network and NFT’s will be offered at a later stage.

### **Coin Metrics.**

**ZNN**

There are currently 5.8 million ZNN in circulation. ( Max after 1 year \~ 8.1 million ) Currently:

* 35% is delegated to Pillars.
* 27% is locked and staked.
* 1.6 million ZNN still need to swap from the Legacy chain.
* 415 000 ZNN are wrapped and on the Binance Smart Chain.

14 400 ZNN are issued daily during the first year, this reduces to \~3% per annum thereafter.

**QSR**

There are currently 26.4 million QSR in circulation. Currently:

* 33% have been burned in the creation of Pillars
* 14% have been locked in the creation of Sentinels
* 5% have been fused for Plasma and Zero-fee transactions.

20 000 QSR are issued daily during the first year, this reduces thereafter.

#### **Legacy ZNN > NoM ZNN**

The Alphanet is live and Legacy ZNN are being swapped for ZNN on the Network of Momentum. All ZNN in the snapshot taken November 22nd can be swapped over to the Syrius wallet on the Network of Momentum. More info on the swap [here. ](swap-to-alphanet.md)

**What is the ZNN coin I see on Exchanges?**&#x20;

While the Network of Momentum was in development the Zenon team put in place a temporary network built on a fork of PIVX, with its own wallet. That wallet is called the Legacy Wallet and the ZNN coin you see on CEX’s is actually a PIVX coin which can be stored ONLY at the Exchange. If you decide to buy the PIVX ZNN it is up to the Exchange to swap those for the new ZNN as they were part of the Snapshot for the transition.&#x20;

### wZNN&#x20;

#### **What is Wrapped ZNN ( wZNN ) ?**&#x20;

The Zenon team created the option to buy and trade a version of ZNN on Pancakeswap on the Binance Smart Chain ( wZNN on BSC ) using a Web.3 wallet like Metamask.&#x20;

You could swap ZNN from your Legacy Wallet on the PIVX chain for wZNN on Binance Smart Chain through a one-way bridge at a cost of 1 ZNN per 100 ZNN swapped.&#x20;

The bridge between the Legacy wallet and the Binance Smart Chain is now closed. A new two-way bridge is being constructed between the Syrius Wallet and Binance Smart Chain.&#x20;

wZNN will remain as a cross-chain version of ZNN.&#x20;

**The wZNN Liquidity Pool contract** ( Updated November 22nd 2021 ): https://bscscan.com/address/0xE6B03fCB16dAf3462DdfB8B0AFb3F0E87d38d884

**Can I swap wZNN on BSC for ZNN on Alphanet?**&#x20;

A two-way bridge is being constructed between Binance Smart Chain and Network of Momentum so you can go from ZNN on NoM to wZNN on Binance Smart Chain and back again if you find liquidity is better on Pancakeswap, or want to hold your ZNN as wZNN in Metamask. We don’t yet know what the fees will be to cross that bridge.&#x20;

**Can I store wZNN in Metamask?**&#x20;

Yes, you can send wZNN to any web3 compatible wallet in the same way you would send any other BSC token to it.&#x20;

**Add liquidity to the wZNN / BNB pool on Pancakeswap.**

**The wZNN contract on BSC changed in November.**

If your Metamask wallet shows a zero balance for wZNN, update the contract:

Click “Add new token” at the bottom of your Metamask BSC token list and add the new token address to find your replaced wZNN.&#x20;

New Token contract address: 0x84b174628911896a3b87fa6980d05dbc2ee74836&#x20;

New Liquidity Pool contract address: 0xE6B03fCB16dAf3462DdfB8B0AFb3F0E87d38d884&#x20;

### Plasma Points Token ( PP )&#x20;

**What can I do with the PP in my Syrius Testnet wallet?**&#x20;

After Alphanet Launch you will receive QSR in exchange for your PP at the rate of 1 QSR for every 1000 PP. This will happen automatically in your Syrius wallet when you update it to the Alphanet version. QSR will have a USD value defined by the market and supply and demand. You will be able to swap QSR for ZNN within your Syrius wallet after Alphanet launch.
