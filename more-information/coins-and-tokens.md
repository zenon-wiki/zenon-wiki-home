# Coins & Tokens

## ZNN <a href="wznn" id="wznn"></a>

#### **What is the ZNN coin currently in circulation?** <a href="what-is-the-znn-coin-currently-in-circulation" id="what-is-the-znn-coin-currently-in-circulation"></a>

While the Network of Momentum has been in development the Zenon team put in place a temporary network built on a fork of PIVX, with its own wallet. That wallet is called the Legacy Wallet and the current ZNN coin you can buy on CEX’s is actually a PIVX coin which can be stored ONLY within the Legacy Zenon Wallet OR on the exchanges where you can buy ZNN.

If you chose to store you PIVX Zennies in the Legacy Wallet you were able to stake your coins for rewards, which arrived as 0.9 ZNN, at intervals depending on the size of your stake and the duration of your wallet being online. ( Hot staking ). Very broadly the rewards were about 0.9 ZNN per 1000 ZNN staked and online per day. This program is still running, but rewards seem to be slowing down.

## wZNN <a href="wznn" id="wznn"></a>

#### **What is Wrapped ZNN ( wZNN ) ?** <a href="what-is-wrapped-znn-wznn" id="what-is-wrapped-znn-wznn"></a>

The Zenon team created the option to buy and trade a version of ZNN on Pancakeswap on the Binance Smart Chain ( wZNN on BSC ) using a Web.3 wallet like Metamask. You could swap ZNN from your Legacy Wallet on the PIVX chain for wZNN on Binance Smart Chain through a one-way bridge at a cost of 1 ZNN per 100 ZNN swapped. ( Send 100 ZNN, receive 99 wZNN ). You are still able to cross the one-way bridge from your Legacy Wallet to BSC if you want to trade your ZNN on Pancakeswap. wZNN is still active and it seems will remain so into the future as a cross-chain version of ZNN.

The wZNN token contract ( Updated November 22nd 2021 ):

The wZNN Liquidity Pool contract ( Updated November 22nd 2021 ):

[https://bscscan.com/address/0xE6B03fCB16dAf3462DdfB8B0AFb3F0E87d38d884](https://bscscan.com/address/0xE6B03fCB16dAf3462DdfB8B0AFb3F0E87d38d884)

#### **What happened with the wZNN / BSC liquidity Pool?**

On 19th November 2021 the Liquidity Pool on the wZNN / BNB Pancakeswap pair was drained by a hacker. In the 24 hours following that the team burnt all wZNN and replaced them with a new contract.

This means that the contract linked on Coingecko and CoinMarketCap with the address **0x8a7ca49f42e5196c26bb00fa014352e5d065db4d** is no longer valid and your Metamask web3 wallet will show a zero balance for wZNN.

**Add the new contract for wZNN.**

Click “Add new token” at the bottom of your Metamask BSC token list and add the new token address to find your replaced wZNN.

New Token contract address:    0x84b174628911896a3b87fa6980d05dbc2ee74836

New Liquidity Pool contract address:    0xE6B03fCB16dAf3462DdfB8B0AFb3F0E87d38d884

#### **Can I swap wZNN on BSC for ZNN on Alphanet?** <a href="can-i-swap-wznn-for-znn" id="can-i-swap-wznn-for-znn"></a>

Once the Zenon Network of Momentum is out of it’s Testnet phase and active ( Alphanet ), you will be able to swap wZNN coins on BSC for ZNN on the Network of Momentum ( NoM ) through a two-way bridge, meaning you can go from ZNN on NoM to wZNN on Binance Smart Chain and back again if you find liquidity is better on Pancakeswap, or want to hold your ZNN as wZNN in Metamask. We don’t yet know what the fees will be to cross that bridge.

#### **Can I store wZNN in Metamask?** <a href="q-can-i-store-wznn-in-metamask" id="q-can-i-store-wznn-in-metamask"></a>

Yes, you can send wZNN to any web3 compatible wallet in the same way you would send any other BSC token to it.

### Plasma Points Token ( PP )

#### **What are Plasma Points/PP?** <a href="what-are-plasma-points-pp" id="what-are-plasma-points-pp"></a>

To drive interest in the project and get people involved a Testnet Syrius wallet was released with an “Incentivization” tab. You were challenged to complete quests and tasks and received Plasma Points ( PP ), the first official token on the Network of Momentum, as reward.

All the PP accrued in your Syrius wallet as rewards have real value. Once the Network of Momentum is launched ( The Big Bang ) You will receive QSR in exchange for your PP at the rate of 1 QSR for every 1000 PP.

#### **What can I do with the PP in my Syrius wallet?**

After Alphanet Launch you will receive QSR in exchange for your PP at the rate of 1 QSR for every 1000 PP. This will happen automatically in your Syrius wallet when you update it to the Alphanet version.

QSR will have a USD value defined by the market and supply and demand. You will be able to swap QSR for ZNN within your Syrius wallet at Alphanet launch. We do not yet know how it will trade - whether it can be bridged to wQSR to trade on Pancakeswap etc. We will simply have to wait to find out.
