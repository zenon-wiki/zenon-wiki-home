# Bridging

#### **Can I bridge from the Legacy Wallet to Binance Smart Chain?**

This is no longer possible. The Legacy chain has ended and all ZNN in the snapshot at block 1.405.000 which occurred on 22nd November 2021 are eligible to swap across to the Alphanet.

#### Can I bridge from the Zenon Alphanet to Binance Smart Chain?

Yes, you are able to swap wZNN coins on BSC for ZNN on the Network of Momentum and vice versa using the latest version of the Syrius Wallet. Swapping ZNN to wZNN allows you to store your wrapped ZNN on a cold wallet via Metamask if you so desire. There is a fee to transfer from ZNN to wZNN, but no fee the other way. Transfer times from Binance Smart Chain to Syrius are about an hour due to requiring substantial validations from the BSC Network.

The official Zenon article for the two-way bridge is [here](https://medium.com/@zenon.network/zenon-building-bridges-272538cde1a7).

There is a random bug where the BNB fee for the transfer is too high - a video to fix this is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9R7lxBoh6Y).

#### **Why is there a bridge to Binance Smart Chain versus other chains?** <a href="#q-why-is-there-a-bridge-to-binance-smart-chain-versus-other-chains" id="q-why-is-there-a-bridge-to-binance-smart-chain-versus-other-chains"></a>

BSC was initially chosen to be used for a one-way bridge because of EVM compatibility and low fees, facilitating ease of transfer for buyers and sellers.

#### **Will Zenon bridge with other chains like Fantom, ETH or AVAX, similar to the current BSC Bridge?** <a href="#q-will-zenon-bridge-with-other-chains-like-fantom-eth-or-avax-similar-to-the-current-bsc-bridge" id="q-will-zenon-bridge-with-other-chains-like-fantom-eth-or-avax-similar-to-the-current-bsc-bridge"></a>

All EVM chains are compatible with the current Zenon Bridge implementation and can be extended to work two-way after Alphanet launch.
