# Timeline

### 2018 - 2021

The Zenon Dual Layer, Dual Coin, Network of Momentum ( NoM ) has been in design and build phase since 2018.

While that has been in development the Zenon team put in place a temporary **Legacy Network** built on a fork of PIVX, with its own wallet. That wallet is called the Legacy Wallet and is the only place besides a CEX to store the PIVX ZNN.&#x20;

### 2021

2021 marked the movement towards the launch of the Network of Momentum.

The **Testnet** of the Network of Momentum was launched in early 2021, with it's own wallet, called S Y R I U S. A faucet was created on Telegram to request tZNN and tQSR so that anyone could launch a wallet and begin testing all functions. To drive participation in the Testnet it was incentivised so that people could receive real rewards for completing tasks and testing functions.

Wrapped ZNN was created ( wZNN ) on the Binance Smart Chain to ensure access to a tradeable and liquid version of ZNN as the Network transitioned across Legacy into Testnet and then on to Alphanet. See [wZNN](faq.md#wznn-wrapped-znn) in the FAQ for more info.

### 2021 -&#x20;

The launch of the functioning first version of the Network of Momentum ( NoM 0 ) is called “The Big Bang” by the Zenon team. This will occur in November 2021. At that time the Syrius wallet will be updated and that update will run on the live Network of Momentum, not the Testnet. NoM 0 is also called the **Alphanet**, this will run for 1 year after which NoM 1 begins.

At Alphanet launch all the functions of the Testnet will roll out on the Alphanet but using ZNN and QSR with real value. Pillars and Sentinels will be active during NoM 0, while Sentries, which have a function in validating and securing the Network, only become possible at NoM 1.&#x20;

The wZNN version of ZNN will remain active on Binance Smart Chain and can be bridged to and from the NoM via Syrius Wallet at will.
