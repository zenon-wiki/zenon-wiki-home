# Timeline

### 2018 - 2021

The Zenon Dual Layer, Dual Coin, Network of Momentum ( NoM ) began itâ€™s development in early 2018 and is ongoing.

While that protocol was being developed the Zenon team put in place a temporary **Legacy Network** built on a fork of PIVX, with its own wallet. That wallet was called the Legacy Wallet and is the only place besides a CEX to store the PIVX ZNN.

### 2021

2021 marked the movement towards the launch of the Network of Momentum.

The **Testnet** of the Network of Momentum was launched in early 2021, with it's own wallet, called S Y R I U S. A faucet was created on Telegram to request tZNN and tQSR so that anyone could launch a wallet and begin testing all functions. To drive participation in the Testnet it was incentivised so that people could receive real rewards for completing tasks and testing functions.

**Wrapped ZNN** was created ( wZNN ) on the Binance Smart Chain to ensure access to a tradeable and liquid version of ZNN as the Network transitioned across Legacy into Testnet and then on to Alphanet. See [wZNN](faq.md#wznn-wrapped-znn) in the FAQ for more info.

### 2021 -&#x20;

The launch of the functioning first version of the Network of Momentum ( NoM 0 ) occurred in November of 2021. At that time the Syrius wallet was updated and launched on the live first version of the Network of Momentum; NoM 0 or **Alphanet.** The Alphanet will run for 1 year after which NoM 1 begins.

At Alphanet launch all the functions of the Testnet rolled out onto the Mainnet using ZNN and QSR with real value. Delegating and Staking are active. Pillars and Sentinels are being launched and are active during NoM 0, while Sentries, which have a function in validating and securing the Network, only become possible at NoM 1.&#x20;

The wZNN version of ZNN will remain active on Binance Smart Chain with a bridge to and from the NoM via the Syrius Wallet. The Bridge is currently being built.
