# Introducing ZENON

Zenon Network is a Dual Layer, Dual Coin, fee-less protocol that has been in design and build phase since early 2018. The protocol itself is called the Network of Momentum ( NoM ) and the coins built into that protocol are Zenon/ZNN and Quasar/QSR.

While the NoM has been in development the Zenon team put in place a temporary network built on a fork of PIVX, with its own wallet. That wallet is called the Legacy Wallet and the current ZNN coin you buy on CEX’s and in OTC channels is actually a PIVX coin which can be stored ONLY within the Legacy Zenon Wallet OR on the exchanges where you can buy ZNN.

#### The Network of Momentum <a href="what-is-zenon-network-of-momentum" id="what-is-zenon-network-of-momentum"></a>

The Zenon Network of Momentum ( NoM ) is an evolutionary “Blockchain” 3.0. It has a Dual Layer Structure with a DAG ( Directed Acyclic Graph ) base layer, and a Block Lattice transaction layer. The Network is secured through both Proof of Work ( PoW ) and Proof of Stake ( PoS ). It is powered by two coins; Zenon/ZNN is the fundamental transactional coin and Quasar/QSR the fuel coin which secures the Network through Proof of Stake.

There are two types of Nodes on the NoM; Pillars and Sentinels. Pillars require high levels of commitment, both in value and resources, to ensure a strong foundation for the NoM, Sentinels require less commitment and allow a broader base to help secure the NoM.

The NoM has a fall-back Proof of Work security mechanism - in that if you do not have Quasar/QSR you will still be able to transact, albeit at a slower pace, by generating Proof of Work for each transaction.

“Fusing” Quasar/QSR within the S Y R I U S wallet bonds the QSR and generates “Plasma” to fuel transactions. The more transactions you do, the more Quasar you need to fuse to drive those transactions. If you do not have enough Quasar the transaction will fall back to PoW to drive it, ensuring that no transaction is ever ‘stuck’ in the Network; it will always get through somehow.

Other than that the Network of Momentum is fee-less.

The Network of Momentum allows for:

* Fee-less transactions through Plasma
* Scalability and speed through the block lattice transaction layer
* Security and stability through the DAG layer
* Deep integration with Bitcoin in the wallet through Taproot
* EVM cross-chain compatibility
* In-wallet creation of Tokens with zero coding knowledge
* A robust platform designed to unlock new possibilities for apps ( zApps )
* The Creation of NFT's
* Staking for QSR rewards and Delegating for ZNN rewards
* Low energy consumption to maintain and secure the Network of Momentum

The Network of Momentum will launch in November 2021. At that time the “Alphanet” will go live.
