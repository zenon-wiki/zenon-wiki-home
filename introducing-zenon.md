# Introducing ZENON

Zenon Network is a Dual Layer, Dual Coin, zero fee protocol in development since early 2018. The protocol itself is called the Network of Momentum ( NoM ) and the coins built into that protocol are Zenon/ZNN and Quasar/QSR.

#### **The Network of Momentum**

The Zenon Network of Momentum is an evolutionary layer 1 blockchain with a Dual Layer Structure; a DAG ( Directed Acyclic Graph ) base layer, and a Block Lattice transaction layer.&#x20;

The Network is secured through both Proof of Stake ( PoS ) and Proof of Work ( PoW ). It is powered by two coins; Zenon/ZNN is the fundamental transactional coin and Quasar/QSR the fuel coin which secures the Network through Proof of Stake.

The validators on the Network are called Pillars and Sentinels. Pillars require high levels of commitment, both in value and resources, to ensure a strong foundation for the NoM, Sentinels require less commitment and allow a broader base to help secure the NoM. RPC nodes connect the wallets to the network.

Zero fee transactions are achieved by ‘fusing’ QSR within the S Y R I U S wallet. Fusing bonds the QSR to the transaction address and generates ‘Plasma' to fuel transactions. The more transactions you do, the more Quasar you need to fuse to drive those transactions. QSR can be un-fused at any time after an initial 10 hour lock with no loss of QSR.

If you do not have enough QSR fused for Plasma the transaction will fall back to PoW to drive it, ensuring that no transaction is ever ‘stuck’ in the Network; it will always get through somehow.

The Network of Momentum allows for:

* Fee-less transactions through Plasma
* Scalability and speed through the block lattice transaction layer
* Security and stability through the DAG layer
* Deep integration with Bitcoin in the wallet through Taproot
* EVM cross-chain compatibility
* In-wallet creation of Tokens with zero coding knowledge
* A robust platform designed to unlock new possibilities for apps ( zApps )
* The Creation of NFT’s
* Delegating for ZNN rewards and Staking for QSR rewards
* Strongly incentivised decentralisation
* Low energy consumption to maintain and secure the Network of Momentum

The Network of Momentum launched with the Alphanet in November 2021 and is live.

**Legacy Network**

While the NoM was in development the Zenon team put in place a temporary network built on a fork of PIVX, with its own wallet. That wallet was called the Legacy Wallet and the ZNN coin you buy on CEX’s and in OTC channels is actually a PIVX coin which can be stored ONLY within the Legacy Zenon Wallet OR on the exchanges where you can buy ZNN.
